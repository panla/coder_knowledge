					# (change requires restart)

# These are only used if logging_collector is on:
log_directory = '/var/lib/postgresql/log'			# directory where log files are written,
					# can be absolute or relative to PGDATA
#log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'	# log file name pattern,
					# can include strftime() escapes
#log_file_mode = 0600			# creation mode for log files,
					# begin with 0 to use octal notation
log_rotation_age = 1d			# Automatic rotation of logfiles will
					# happen after that time.  0 disables.
log_rotation_size = 1000MB		# Automatic rotation of logfiles will
					# happen after that much log output.
					# 0 disables.



# - When to Log -
#log_min_duration_statement = -1	# -1 is disabled, 0 logs all statements
					# and their durations, > 0 logs only
					# statements running at least this number
					# of milliseconds



# - What to Log -
log_timezone = 'Asia/Shanghai'



# - Locale and Formatting -
